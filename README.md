# AdminSDHolder / SDProp: Cleanup-AdminCount
A <ins>**language independent(!)**</ins> Powershell Script to remove orphaned AdminCount=1 on User objects in Active Directory and enable ACL inheritance from parent OU.
Repair/Cleanup User Accounts, protected by sdprop/AdminSDHolder process in Active Directory, that are no longer Member of one of the Protected Groups.

The Script doesn´t work initialliy with the displayname of the the group. The problem is, that´s a localized name and there is **more than** english. 

The script uses the best common denominator: The Well-Known SID. Simple as that.
The report of group membership is the localized version of the group.  

Groups protected by sdprop (AdminSDHolder) process.
